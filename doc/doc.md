Aim(For Version 0.0.1)
----------------------

The `Pigtime` provide the C-function as its interface. It can easily initialize
a new `Pigtime` database. It will hold a folder named `.pigtime` at the current
work folder.

That's why it need support:

- able to initialize a `Pigtime` database.
- able to delete it.
- able to check if here a `Pigtime` database.
- able to get a file by c-string like `"/temp.txt"`, `"/graph/temp.txt"`.
- echo of objects need a ID that differs with others.

Example
-------

It is easy for it to hold a complex relation of files. Such as a lot of notes:
You can get one note though `/time/2020-4-13/<name-of-file>` or 
`/tags/python/<name-of-file>` or `/tags/what_my_girl_like/<name-of-file>` or
some else. -- Just because this database is on graph but not tree! (oh man,
graph is complex but it do helpful if you use it carefully).

Or you can manager a message book, which have a lot of info that you can get by
`/messagebook/name/peter` or `/messagebook/sex/M/peter`(maybe there are a lot
of people named Peter, so need it return a list?)

Thinking Question
-----------------

(I do not think it should think now, it is important to make other think enable)

Question List:

- Do we need to wrap it with C++ STL structure? Such as
  `PgNodeList -> std::vector<PgNode>`
